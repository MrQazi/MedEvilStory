2. In a dirty room that looks like a cage, there is a couple with a baby. The woman whines: "What will they do to him, Tristan?" And the man replies: "Our son is their successful experiment, Rachel. He is the chosen purple kid..." And suddenly, "Boom!" The scene moves outside the castle. A mob swarms over it and trees and rocks fly through the air and destroy it. The couple escaped into the forest through a hole created in the wall, and ran.The frightening character (Amraphel) throws people to the air with his telekinetic powers, and chases the fleeing couple. The couple hides the child among bushes, and turns to fight. The father pulls out a pair of swords and stands in front of Amrapel, while Amraphel floats a lot of rocks and trees in the air. The father runs up to him, Amrapel throws everything at him, and the scene fades away. The baby is alone in the woods, and an old man in brown clothes collects it, looks in all directions, and disappears into the woods. The scene fades away.
