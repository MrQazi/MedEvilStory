3. A lovable home in New Jersey. Aiden (the growing baby, thin and with a brown hair) is watching TV (wearing a Tshirt and jeans). His mother shouts from the kitchen "Aiden Conner! Go pick up your little sister Lucy from school, and stop watching fantasy shows - these things don't exist!" And Aidan comes out of the house grumpy (and a thought bubble over his head says: "That's why you shouldn't live with adoptive parents. They're interfering with your enjoyment!"). On the way he sees children abusing a thin, bespectacled child in a side alley. Aiden jumps up to hide behind a garbage can to peek away angrily. The bespectacled boy says "Is that all you can do?" And gets beaten up. Aiden wonders what to do, and finally says "The stupid kid needs help". He grabs a stick in his hand, and tries to use it to drop an object standing on top of the cluttered tin (it could be a broken chair, a broken table, a board, whatever). Evenbefore he touches it, the object begins to move by itself (and around Aidan there is a drop of purple aura when it happens). Aidan blinks and tries again, and the object moves again, flies through the air, and hits the boys. The boys escape, and suddenly a sturdy man dressed as a military general appears. The general says: "A boy with a very interesting purple aura ... you will probably like to come to our school ..." He pulls a note out of his pocket, gives it to Aiden, and leaves. Above Aiden's head appears a bubble wonders: "Purple aura ...?". As Aiden turns in astonishment to the bespectacled boy he rescued, the boy jumps up and runs away.
