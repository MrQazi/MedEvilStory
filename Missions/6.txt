7. Aidan arrives at the forest wearing a long green hood this time. At the entrance there is a stone with an arrow on it, and six children besides it are waiting: one tall and fat, one small and bespectacled, one small and thin black hair, one blonde with glasses, one tall blond and muscular, and one prominent and mysterious with a chinchilla on her shoulder. They are all wearing long green hoods. Everyone says their name. "Hi, I'm Leo." "I'm Helena." "I'm Jerry." "I'm Timmy ..." "I'm Carlis." respite. "I'm Diana. And we just have to keep an eye on the arrows." Then they turn and walk in the woods, following arrows and guides on trees.
